# Copy to .env and fill in values as needed.

# ---- user-service (AWS Cognito) ----
AWS_REGION=us-east-1
# Dev pool provided for this project:
COGNITO_USER_POOL_ID=us-east-1_TppiqQvor
COGNITO_CLIENT_ID=...
# Only if your Cognito App Client has a secret:
# COGNITO_CLIENT_SECRET=...

# AWS credentials are required for the user-service to call Cognito.
# For local `go run`, you can also rely on your AWS profile (~/.aws) via `aws configure`.
# For Docker/Docker Compose, the simplest is to pass credentials as env vars:
# AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=...
# AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=...
# AWS_SESSION_TOKEN=...

# Optional: enables admin endpoints in user-service
# ADMIN_API_KEY=change-me
